# Volve Wells Production

## Analyze Volve Field Producer Well Data

The primary purpose of this analysis is to identify and explain differences in the production data of the producer wells situated in the Volve field. The objective of this study is to provide helpful information to the petroleum management team, which can help them identify wells that are producing significant amounts of oil and gas while also highlighting which wells are showing signs of decreased productivity and may require attention to prevent further decline.

## Executive Summary

The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of production data from the producer wells in the Volve field. The primary focus is on identifying and explaining differences in the production data, aiming to provide valuable insights for effective field management.

The problem at hand revolves around the nuanced analysis of Volve field production data and its direct impact on intervention prioritization and resource allocation optimization. By scrutinizing the production data, the aim is to distinguish wells that are producing significant amounts of oil and gas from those exhibiting signs of declining productivity. This analysis is crucial for informing targeted interventions and ensuring the efficient allocation of resources.

In essence, the project seeks to bridge the gap between production data disparities and strategic decision-making within the Volve field. The overarching goal is to empower the petroleum management team with actionable insights, enabling them to proactively address challenges and maximize the overall productivity of the wells.

This reputable platform provides access to the Volve data, ensuring the reliability and integrity of the dataset for professional use and analysis.

The dataset consists of daily production records from the Volve field. The main components necessary for the analysis are the production date, well identification codes, and production metrics for oil, gas, and water. These data elements are essential for conducting a comprehensive and rigorous analytical examination.

## Pre-Processing

The initial step review of the data description is a foundational measure to facilitate a streamlined analysis process. Subsequently, the application of univariate data analysis techniques, including box plots, distribution plots, and empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) plots, is employed following the project's methodology. An application of scatter plots is utilized to derive insightful analyses. This systematic approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, enabling robust and informed analytical outcomes.

## Conclusion

*   Six out of the seven wells were identified as oil producers (OP) and retained in the dataset.
*   The box plot reveals the presence of outliers in oil production exceeding approximately 3,000 units and gas production surpassing 460,000 units.
*   The distribution plot reveals a notable frequency of wells yielding zero oil, gas, and water production output.
*   The ECDF plot highlights Well #7405 as having the highest proportion of instances with zero oil and gas production at 40%, with Well #7289 and Well #5769 closely following at 18-22% each.
*   The scatter-plot analysis reveals that Well #5599 and Well #5351 exhibit characteristics indicative of wells with the most substantial oil and gas production throughout the specified year.
